Basic Functionality:
	- Display a welcome message and the range of input voltages
	- Constantly update the current DC voltage applied to the ADC
	- A hold button may be pressed to hold the current value
	- Pressing the hold button again resumes measurement

Advanced Functionality:
	- A second ADC connected to the PIC to measure a secondary DC / voltage differential
	- Pressing a mode button shows the maximum voltage applied
	- Pressing a sample button stores in memory
	- An alarm feature should sound a buzzer if voltage falls below a threshold
	- The built in timer for the PIC should measure and display the time it spends below threshold

Separate functions required:
/	- Function for welcome message
/	- Function to measure calculate the DC voltage applied
/	- Maybe function to check hold
/	- Function to show the maximum voltage applied
/	- Function to time and display the time spent below threshold
	- Maybe function to display voltage if it's more than a few lines

Pins taken (out of 13):
	- LCD		7 pins
	- ADC		3 pins
		second ADC would maybe require multiplexing and extra pin for button
	- Interrupt 2 pins	(RB0, 4-7)

For the hold button:
	Add a flag for whether held or not
	Toggle flag in interrupt
	If statement in main loop to check whether held or not

Misc:
	Displaying the number shouldn't be part of any other functions
