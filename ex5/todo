Basic Functionality:
	- Display a welcome message and the range of input voltages
	- Constantly update the current DC voltage applied to the ADC
	- A hold button may be pressed to hold the current value
	- Pressing the hold button again resumes measurement

Advanced Functionality:
	- A second ADC connected to the PIC to measure a secondary DC / voltage differential
	- Pressing a mode button shows the maximum voltage applied
	- Pressing a sample button stores in memory
	- An alarm feature should sound a buzzer if voltage falls below a threshold
	- The built in timer for the PIC should measure and display the time it spends below threshold
			Could add to the volt function

Separate functions required:
*	- Function for welcome message
*	- Function to measure calculate the DC voltage applied
*	- Maybe function to check hold
*	- Function to show the maximum voltage applied
*	- Function to time and display the time spent below threshold
	- Maybe function to display voltage if it's more than a few lines

Pins taken (out of 13):
	- LCD		6 pins (Maybe 5)
	- ADC		3 pins (Maybe 2)
		second ADC would maybe require multiplexing and extra pin for button
	- Interrupt 2 pins	(RB0, RB7)	(Plus extra pin for third button)
		Hold button as RB0
			Holds the current value
			Pressing max button displays current voltage alongside max
			Pressing Sample button samples it
		Switch ADC button
			Toggles between ADC1, ADC2 and differential
		Need to connect a third button somewhere
	- Buzzer 	1 pin

For the hold button:
	Add a flag for whether held or not
	Toggle flag in interrupt
	If statement in main loop to check whether held or not

Misc:
	Displaying the number shouldn't be part of any other functions
	Just connect R/W for the LCD to ground

Immediate Jobs:
	Fix header file pins
